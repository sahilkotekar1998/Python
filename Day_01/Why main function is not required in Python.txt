In Python, main function is not required because the Python interpreter executes from the top of the file unless a specific 
function is defined with the keyword "def".

e.g.


print("first")
print("second")
print("third")
def disp():
    print("disp 1")
    print("disp 2")
    print("disp 3")
print("fourth")
print("fifth")


o/p

first
second
third
fourth
fifth
